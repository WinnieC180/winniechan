It was a fast-paced, highly collaborative coding project that grew to over 1,600 lines of code and required constant iteration and refinement of our ideas. As a team, we explored multiple concepts, evaluating what was both feasible and impactful, in order to meet the project requirements and complete it within the allotted time. \n\n Through this process, I learned a great deal about collaboration and the realities of building a project as a group. Balancing creativity with practicality. I also gained valuable experience in prioritizing features, understanding when to refine ideas, and recognizing which features to set aside to keep the project reasonable, functional, and enjoyable for everyone.",

Within a 30-second time limit, players test their reaction speed by hitting as many geese as possible, with the challenge increasing as more geese spawn over time. But there’s a twist! The game features an alternate mode called “People,” where—thanks to volunteers from our AP Computer Science A class—photos of fellow CS students and even our teacher take on the role of the geese, adding a personalized and humorous element to the gameplay.",

          "For our final project, we presented Quack a Goose! to our AP Computer Science A class, and it was chosen as the second-best project by our peers. And of course, the $5 Amazon gift card we earned felt like a fun and rewarding bonus after all the hard work. Creating Quack a Goose was both an enjoyable and educational experience that challenged me to think deeply about game design, user engagement, and collaboration. Designing a fast-paced game within a 30-second time limit required careful consideration of pacing and difficulty, especially as more geese spawned over time to keep players engaged. This project also marked my first time working collaboratively on a large-scale coding project, which taught me how important communication and teamwork are when developing complex programs. One of the most rewarding aspects of the project was adding the “People” game mode. Incorporating photos of classmates and our teacher, with their permission, made the game more personal and entertaining, and demonstrated how small creative decisions can significantly enhance the user experience. This feature pushed me to think beyond basic functionality and consider how personalization and humor can make a project more memorable.",
